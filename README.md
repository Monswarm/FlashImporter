### Features

- Automatically generates a spritemap in Unity3D from an atlas generated in Adobe Animate or Flash
- Asign a name to each sprite with from layers names in Adobe Animate.
- Sprites can be modified and generated at any time without breaking the game, because the names are imported from the layer information. Only you have to be sure that new images are in the end of the layer.
- Cat sprite to use for **free** in your own projects!
